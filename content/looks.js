// Anything in the world with real art instead of a generated placeholder: people below,
// buildings at the foot of the file. Everyone not named here is still drawn out of
// PALETTES in tuning.js, and nothing has to change for them.
//   id       — the name the rest of the game calls this look by. Put it in the
//              `palette` field of content/npcs.js and content/party.js.
//   path     — the folder under art/ the export was unzipped into, as exported.
//   size     — the side of one frame in pixels. Every frame in a set is square.
//   foot     — how far down the frame the ground is. Measured once off the art: it is
//              what stands the character on the tile rather than floating over it.
//   walk     — folder of the walk cycle, and how many frames each direction has.
//   idle     — the same for standing still. Frame 0 is what they wear when nothing is
//              happening to them.
//   down     — one image, for when they are laid out on the floor. Leave it out for
//              anyone the game never puts on the floor; nothing else asks for it.
//   portrait — the face shown while they speak.
// The four direction folders are named the way the export names them; src/art.js maps
// them onto up, down, left and right. Add a character by dropping the export under
// art/ and adding a block.

// they are what you walk into, and repairing still moves them — but where a building
// is named here the picture is what you see standing on them.
//   id     — the building in content/buildings.js. Its stages and this list line up in
//            order: first picture for the first stage, and so on down.
//   path   — the folder under art/ the export was unzipped into.
//   at     — where the top-left corner of the picture sits, in tiles. Fractions are
//            fine: it is placed by eye against the walls it is standing on.

//            Defaults to grass. The tiles keep their collision either way: the walls
//            still stop you, they just stop drawing themselves.
//   stages — one image per stage of repair, lowest first. A stage past the end of the

// Ground drawn from a painted sheet instead of the tile generator in src/textures.js.
// The sheets are painted at tilePx (see tuning.js) to a tile — four times the size of a

//   cells — [x, y] of each patch to cut, in sheet pixels. Four of them, laid out two by
//           two across the map, so a field of grass does not repeat every tile. Cut
//           from parts of the sheet that are all one material.
